This is a simple RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator built using [`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/).

Click [here](https://jessekelighine.shinyapps.io/reverse-polish/) to use the application on [`shinylive.io`](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
Or click [here](https://jessekelighine.com/reverse-polish/) to use the application built using [`shinylive`](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/),
but it takes a bit longer to load.
