# RPN Calculator

This is a simple RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator built using [`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/) and [`shinylive`](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/).

**Note**:
There is currently something wrong with $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ rendering with `shinylive`.
You can find visit the `shinylive` version of the website [here](https://jessekelighine.shinyapps.io/reverse-polish/) where the $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ is not rendered properly,
or you can visit the website [here](https://jessekelighine.shinyapps.io/reverse-polish/)
on	[`shinyapps.io`](https://www.shinyapps.io/) where $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ is rendered correctly.
